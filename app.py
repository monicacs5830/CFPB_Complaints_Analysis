# The graph above displays the number of complaints associated with various financial product categories. The product category that received the most complaints was "credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports." This category had 1.6 million complaints, indicating that consumers faced numerous issues and challenges with credit reporting, repair services, and other similar personal consumer reports.
#
# Following closely behind was the product category of debt collection, which received more than 0.4 million complaints. Debt collection practices are often a contentious issue, and the significant number of complaints highlights the difficulties consumers encountered with debt collectors.
#
# Next in line was the mortgage product category, with just below 0.4 million complaints. Mortgages being a significant financial commitment for consumers, it is not surprising to observe a substantial number of complaints in this area.
#
# The remaining product categories had a considerably lower number of complaints, all below 0.2 million counts. This suggests that compared to credit reporting, debt collection, and mortgages, other product categories had fewer reported issues or complaints from consumers.
#
# Notably, the virtual currency product category received the fewest complaints in the dataset (almost none). This implies that virtual currencies, such as cryptocurrencies, were relatively less problematic for consumers, at least based on the reported complaints.
#
# Overall, the graph provides valuable insights into consumer concerns and pain points across various financial product categories. It highlights the areas where companies and regulators may need to focus their efforts to improve consumer experiences and address potential issues more effectively.

# Based on the graph, an analysis of the distribution of complaints across various issue and subissue categories reveals the following key findings:
#
# Among all the issues, the most common complaint category was "incorrect information on one's report," with a significant count of 800,000 complaints. This suggests that a large number of consumers faced challenges due to inaccuracies in their credit reports.
#
# The second most prevalent issue was related to credit reporting companies' investigations into existing problems, which garnered over 400,000 complaints. Consumers expressed concerns about the effectiveness and thoroughness of these investigations.
#
# Another prominent issue was the "improper use of the report," with more than 300,000 complaints. This indicates that consumers encountered instances where their credit reports were utilized inappropriately.
#
# Furthermore, the issue of "attempting to collect debt not owed" received significant attention, with more than 100,000 complaints. This suggests that a considerable number of consumers faced collection attempts for debts they did not owe.
#
# On the other end of the spectrum, the issue with the least number of complaints was related to "written notification about debt," with less than 100,000 complaints. This issue seems to have affected relatively fewer consumers compared to other problems.
#
# Examining subissues within the category of "incorrect information on the report," complaints primarily revolved around "information belonging to someone else," accounting for over 500,000 complaints. Additionally, there were notable complaints about "incorrect account information" and "incorrect status" on credit reports, with 99,000 and 98,000 complaints, respectively.
#
# Conversely, the subissue of "incorrect personal information" received the least number of complaints, with only 50,000 reported cases.
#
# In summary, the graph's analysis sheds light on the most prevalent issues and subissues faced by consumers, emphasizing the importance of addressing inaccuracies in credit reports and the need for improved practices by credit reporting companies.

# According to the graph above, it illustrates the number of company responses to complaints, categorized by different methods of complaint submission. The submission method that received the highest number of company responses was through the web.
#
# For all types of submission methods, the most common company response was to close the complaints with an explanation. This indicates that a significant proportion of complaints were resolved by providing consumers with a detailed explanation of the actions taken or the reasons behind the issues raised.
#
# The next most frequent company response was to close the complaints with non-monetary relief. This suggests that many complaints were resolved by offering remedies or solutions that did not involve monetary compensation but aimed to address the concerns and provide some form of resolution.
#
# Responses categorized as "in progress" or "closed with monetary relief" followed closely after non-monetary relief. This implies that some complaints required ongoing attention or were ultimately resolved with financial compensation to the affected consumers.
#
# However, there were notable issues with certain submission methods. Specifically, complaints submitted via referral, phone, postal mail, or fax had low number of responses and web referral or email complaints were not responded to at all by the company. This highlights a concerning lack of responsiveness from companies to complaints submitted through these channels.
#
# In summary, the graph reveals that web submissions were the most common method for consumers to submit complaints, and most of these complaints received responses in the form of explanations or non-monetary relief. Nevertheless, there was a need for improvement in addressing complaints submitted via web referral or email, as companies failed to respond to those submissions.

# The graph provides a comprehensive overview of the trends in company responses to consumer complaints from 2012 to 2023. Below are the examinations of the key findings:
#
# 1. **In Progress Responses:** In 2023, there were some "in progress" responses recorded, likely indicating ongoing resolution efforts. Since these responses were not closed at the time of data collection, their numbers were limited to the year 2022.
#
# 2. **Untimely Responses:** Throughout the entire time period, untimely responses remained consistently low in number, suggesting that companies generally responded to complaints in a timely manner.
#
# 3. **Responses Closed with or without Relief:** There was a notable peak in the number of responses closed with or without relief in 2012, followed by a decline to zero, which remained consistent until 2022. This could indicate a change in company practices or data collection methods over the years.
#
# 4. **Responses Closed with Monetary Relief:** The number of responses closed with monetary relief ranged between 20 and 50 (moving average) from 2012 to 2023, showing a consistent approach by companies in offering financial compensation to resolve certain complaints.
#
# 5. **Responses Closed with Non-Monetary Relief:** From 2012 to the end of 2021, responses closed with non-monetary relief remained relatively low, with an average of around 100. However, there was a significant increase in this category starting in 2022, with the number of responses peaking below 1000. This could indicate an increasing focus on providing non-financial remedies to address consumer grievances.
#
# 6. **Responses Closed with Explanation:** The number of responses closed with an explanation displayed a gradual increase from 2012, starting from zero. The trend peaked in 2023, with a moving average of just below 2000, indicating that companies were more actively providing detailed explanations to consumers in response to their complaints.
#
# 7. **Simply Closed Responses:** The number of responses simply closed was relatively high, ranging from 10 to 16 (moving average) from 2012. However, these responses dropped to zero before 2018 and remained consistently low until 2023. This suggests a potential shift in how companies handled certain types of complaints during this period.
#
# Overall, the graph above highlights the trends in company responses to consumer complaints over the years. While some response categories remained relatively stable, there were significant changes in others, indicating evolving practices and a potential focus on more thorough explanations and non-monetary remedies in recent times. The data offers valuable insights into how companies addressed consumer complaints and grievances during this decade-long period.

# The graph provides a detailed overview of the top 4 complaint issues with the highest number of complaints each year from 2012 to 2023. Let's summarize the findings:
#
# 1) **2012 and 2013:** The highest number of complaints in these years were related to loan modification, debt collection, and foreclosure issues. The number of complaints for each issue was close, with loan modification having 22,140 complaints and debt collection with 29,138 complaints.
#
# 2) **2014 to 2016:** During this period, the main complaint issue was "incorrect information on credit report." The number of complaints gradually increased from 21,581 in 2014 to 25,460 in 2015, and further to 32,570 in 2016.
#
# 3) **2017 to 2022:** "Incorrect information on one's report" emerged as the primary concern for consumers in these years. The number of complaints exhibited a steady upward trend, rising from 37,969 in 2017 to 196,491 in 2020. Although there was a slight decrease in 2021 (165,128 complaints), it reached a peak in 2022 with 229,641 complaints.
#
# 4) **2023 (up to the current date):** As of the present data, the most complained issue in 2023 is "improper use of one's report," with 74,883 complaints so far.
#
# Overall, the graph indicates that concerns related to credit reporting, such as incorrect information on reports, have consistently dominated the top complaint categories for consumers over the years. The data also suggests a notable increase in the number of complaints in recent years, particularly regarding issues with credit reports, signaling a growing area of consumer frustration and attention.

# The graph presents the distribution of different types of company responses to consumer complaints. The majority of company responses, accounting for 75.5%, were **closed with explanation**. This indicates that most complaints were addressed by providing consumers with detailed explanations or clarifications.
#
# The next highest percentage of company responses, at 16.3%, fell under **closed with non-monetary relief**. This suggests that a significant portion of complaints were resolved by offering remedies or solutions that did not involve financial compensation.
#
# Only a small fraction, approximately 3.74%, of the complaints were **closed with monetary relief**. This means that a relatively small number of complaints were resolved with financial compensation provided to the affected consumers.
#
# Based on the data, 2.99% of the complaint reports were still **in progress**, with the likelihood that most of these responses were either in the process of being resolved or had not been closed at the time of data collection.
#
# Reports **closed with or without relief** and those with **untimely company response** each constituted less than 1% of the overall company response types. This suggests that these response categories were relatively less common in addressing consumer complaints.
#
# In summary, the graph indicates that the majority of consumer complaints received thorough attention through explanations from companies, while a notable portion received non-monetary relief. The relatively low percentage of complaints closed with monetary relief suggests that financial compensation was not the primary resolution approach. Additionally, the presence of complaints still "in progress" underscores the ongoing efforts to address consumer concerns. Overall, the data provides valuable insights into how companies handled various types of consumer complaints.

# Based on the graph above, we can observe the following dispute rates for different resolution methods:
#
# - Closed: Approximately 26.5% of complaints that were simply "Closed" ended up in a dispute.
# - Closed with explanation: About 24.2% of complaints that were "Closed with explanation" resulted in a dispute.
# - Closed with monetary relief: Only about 11.3% of complaints that were "Closed with monetary relief" resulted in a dispute.
# - Closed with non-monetary relief: About 12.4% of
# complaints that were "Closed with non-monetary relief" ended up in a dispute.
# - Untimely response: The dataset doesn't provide enough information to calculate a dispute rate for "Untimely response".
#
#
# From the available data, it appears that complaints resolved with **monetary relief** have a lower likelihood of resulting in a dispute compared to other resolution methods (11.3%). Conversely, complaints **closed with explanation** or simply **closed** have relatively higher dispute rates (24.2% and 26.5%, respectively).
#
#
# However, it is essential to conduct further statistical analysis and consider additional factors to establish a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between resolution methods and dispute likelihood. Factors such as the nature of the complaint, company response quality, and consumer satisfaction might play significant roles in determining the dispute rates. Further research and analysis would be necessary to draw more definitive conclusions.

        For all types of submission methods, the most common company response was to close the complaints with an explanation. This indicates that a significant proportion of complaints were resolved by providing consumers with a detailed explanation of the actions taken or the reasons behind the issues raised.
        The next most frequent company response was to close the complaints with non-monetary relief. This suggests that many complaints were resolved by offering remedies or solutions that did not involve monetary compensation but aimed to address the concerns and provide some form of resolution.
        Responses categorized as "in progress" or "closed with monetary relief" followed closely after non-monetary relief. This implies that some complaints required ongoing attention or were ultimately resolved with financial compensation to the affected consumers.
        However, there were notable issues with certain submission methods. Specifically, complaints submitted via referral, phone, postal mail, or fax had low numbers of responses, and web referral or email complaints were not responded to at all by the company.
